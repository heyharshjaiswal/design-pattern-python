Favor object composition over class inheritance.

Example:
"""
Behind every successful man, there is always a women to encourage and support her...
"""

Inheritance can be used to represent the different types of women (e.g., mother, wife, sister, daughter) as subclasses of a common "Woman" base class.

and

Composition can be used to represent the different types of support (e.g., mother's support, wife's support, sister's support, daughter's inspiration) as separate classes that can be composed within a "SuccessfulMan" class.
